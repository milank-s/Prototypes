I’ve become inspired by “Tristano”, an aleatoric novel by Nanni
Balestrini as grist for a potential thesis. The project would
combine combinatorial writing with game dynamics to repeatedly
 retell a story. Conceptually, my interest is to restructure a
 narrative with a short game loop, resulting in a mantra the
 player constructs over time. The output is in line with a 
sustained interest in myth-making, where the game re-intrudes 
into reality like the glimpse of the extraordinary in a magical

realist fiction.
